‚≠ê **Backend Project for Thinkful's Software Engineering program** ‚≠ê

‚ùó **Project Prompt:** 

You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.

### Learning objectives
This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

- Running tests from the command line
- Using common middleware packages
- Receiving requests through routes
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
- Building an API following RESTful design principles
- Writing custom middleware functions

For this project, you will be creating a server to access two resources, ```dishes``` and ```orders```, in addition to error handling.
Your server should follow the structure that you've learned in the program. Complete the following tasks to pass the tests: 

### Tasks
- In the ```src/dishes/dishes.controller.js``` file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, and list dishes. Note that dishes cannot be deleted.
- In the ```src/dishes/dishes.router.js``` file, add two routes: ```/dishes``` and ```/dishes/:dishId```. Attach the handlers (create, read, update, and list) exported from ```src/dishes/dishes.controller.js```.
- In the ```src/orders/orders.controller.js``` file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, delete, and list orders.
- In the ```src/orders/orders.router.js``` file, add two routes: ```/orders``` and ```/orders/:orderId```. Attach the handlers (create, read, update, delete, and list) exported from ```src/orders/orders.controller.js```.
- Anytime you need to assign a new ```id``` to an order or dish, use the ```nextId``` function exported from ```src/utils/nextId.js```

## üìì Project Requirements and Acceptance Criteria
### Project rubric
For your project to pass, all of the following statements must be true:

- All tests are passing.
- All middleware and handler functions have a single responsibility and are named functions.
- All data passed between middleware and handler functions uses ```response.locals```.
- All chained method calls on a ```route(...)``` end with ```all(methodNotAllowed)```.
- All update handlers guarantee that the ```id``` property of the stored data cannot be overwritten.

### Routes
To complete this project, you will create the following routes:

#### ```GET /dishes```
This route will respond with a list of all existing dish data.

- Example request:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/dishes
```
- Example response:
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",
      "name": "Dolcelatte and chickpea spaghetti",
      "description": "Spaghetti topped with a blend of dolcelatte and fresh chickpeas",
      "price": 19,
      "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1279330/pexels-photo-1279330.jpeg?h=530&w=350"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ```POST /dishes```
This route will save the dish and respond with the newly created dish.

- **Validation**
    - If any of the following validations fail, respond with a status code of ```400``` and an error message.
        - **Validation ------------ Error message**:

    "dishes": [
      {
        "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",
        "name": "Dolcelatte and chickpea spaghetti",
        "description": "Spaghetti topped with a blend of dolcelatte and fresh chickpeas",

        "price": 19,
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

*Note: Each dish in the Order's ```dishes``` property is a complete copy of the dish, rather than a reference to the dish by ```ID```. This is so the order does not change retroactively if the dish data is updated some time after the order is created.*

- Example Response:

Status ```201```
